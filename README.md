# MovieApp

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.1.4. Node.js version 22 is recommended.

## API url

Generate an environment.ts file with the property 'apiURL' to store the API url and key. Be aware that the API key can still be read from the dev tools/network sniffing.

## Development server

Ensure you have installed all dependencies first with:

```bash
npm install
```

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.
